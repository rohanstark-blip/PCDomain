    q: "How much RAM do I need for gaming?",
    a: "For most modern games, 16GB of RAM is the sweet spot. However, 32GB is becoming the new standard for future-proofing and for users who multitask with streaming or other applications."
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between an SSD and an HDD?",
    a: "An SSD (Solid State Drive) is much faster than an HDD (Hard Disk Drive) because it has no moving parts. Your operating system and frequently played games will load significantly faster from an SSD. HDDs offer more storage for a lower price, making them great for mass file storage."
  },
  {
    q: "How do I choose the right PSU?",
    a: "Your Power Supply Unit (PSU) should have enough wattage to handle the combined power draw of your CPU and GPU, plus about 150-200W of extra headroom for stability and future upgrades. Our AI compatibility checker handles this for you!"
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a CPU cooler, or does it come with the processor?",
    a: "Some CPUs come with a stock cooler included, while high-performance processors often don't. Even if a cooler is included, many builders opt for an aftermarket cooler for better thermal performance and quieter operation."
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between DDR4 and DDR5 RAM?",
    a: "DDR5 is the newer standard offering higher speeds and bandwidth than DDR4. However, it requires a compatible motherboard and CPU. For most users, DDR4 still provides excellent performance at a better price point."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I save and share my PC builds?",
    a: "Yes! Once you create an account, you can save unlimited builds to your profile. You can access them anytime, load them back into the builder, or delete old builds you no longer need."
  },
  {
    q: "How does the AI compatibility checker work?",
    a: "Our AI checks three critical compatibility factors: CPU socket matching with motherboard, RAM type compatibility, and PSU wattage sufficiency. It alerts you instantly if there are any mismatches in your build."
  },
  {
    q: "What resolution should I target for gaming?",
    a: "1080p (Full HD) is great for budget builds, 1440p (2K) offers a sweet spot of performance and visuals, and 4K requires high-end components. Your GPU is the most important factor for gaming resolution."
